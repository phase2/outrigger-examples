  # Operational base service definition for Local environment.

  # Base service definition for Local environment.
  #
  # This is not a fully operational build container, lacking access to other
  # services such as the database or cache needed to properly interact with the
  # application.
  #
  # Uses for this container include filesystem operations. For example:
  #
  # docker-compose -f build.yml run --rm base 'rm -Rf node_modules'
  #
  # Other services inherit these settings via the extends property.
  # See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#extending-services

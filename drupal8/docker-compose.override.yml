# Local development override for docker-compose.yml.
#
# This file overrides docker-compose.yml with local development practices.
#
# Overrides:
# Replaces the standard volume mount that shares code into the Docker
# container with a named volume managed by Outrigger.
#
# Run 'rig project sync' to start syncing.
# @see http://docs.outrigger.sh/project-setup/filesystem-sync/
#
# This configuration is automatically applied by default (when you **do not**
specify the `-f` flag.)
#
# To skip including this configuration, run 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ...'

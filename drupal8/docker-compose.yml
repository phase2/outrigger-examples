    links:

    # These src:dest pairs get mapped into the container at the
    # dest path and override what was built into the image. Both
    # a directory and an individual file can be overridden.
    #
    # Relative src paths and absolute ones pointing inside your home
    # directory will pull in contents from your host machine.
    #
    # Paths using /data are persistent and shared within the docker
    # machine so they should be namespaced (the value of
    # com.dnsdock.image) was used in this case to create a base of /data/d8

# Example Swagger Utilities

These simple Swagger Docker definitions allow quickly and easily spinning up various tools
without need for any installation process. These tools are currently focused on Swagger v2.

* **ui**: Locally host an instance of the Swagger UI, point it to the Swagger
  description of your API of interest.
* **editor**: Design a new API via Swagger, and use the built-in tools to preview
  the description or download auto-generated
  stub client or server code in the language of your choice.
* **generator-cli**: Use the same code generation option for work-in-progress
  Swagger descriptions to produce code for already existing API descriptions.
* **generator**: A webservice wrapper around generator-cli that allows you to POST
  a swagger description and retrieve the generated code.

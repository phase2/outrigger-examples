# Mailhog Development SMTP Server

## Usage

Start mailhog with `docker-compose up`
 
You can also add the `mail` service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file to your projects compose file.

sure to configure the web server with network 

## Network Access to the Mail Service

Access to mailhog from the web server is enabled by adding the mail service to the web containers `links` configuration.
If the project has a separate build container, that container will need an external link in order to reach the mail service.

In other "operational" services of your docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  web-or-other-service:
    links:
      - mail
```

In a separate build container configuration (build.yml):

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  operational:
    external_links:
      # For the left-side, use the docker container name instead of the docker-compose service name.
      - projectname_mail:mail
```

## Drupal

Use the [SMTP module](https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp) in your project.

### Composer-based Installation

```
composer require --dev drupal/smtp
```

> If your production codebase may need SMTP configuration, remove the `--dev`
flag above. You will need to be sure to vary the SMTP module configuration
by environment.


### Environment Configuration

Add the following configuration to your settings.php for the dev environment:

#### Drupal 7 format

```
$conf['smtp_host'] = 'mail';
$conf['smtp_port'] = '1025';
```

#### Drupal 8 format

```
$config['smtp_host'] = 'mail';
$config['smtp_port'] = '1025';
```

### Manual Installation & Configuration

* Install the SMTP module.
* Navigate to `admin/config/system/smtp`
* Enable SMTP mail transport (Special config form option to "Turn this module on".)
* Enter anything into the form for host and port, you may repeat the environment
  configuration above but it will be silently overridden by our settings.php

### Testing

* Send a test email from the SMTP module configuration page.
* Navigate your browser to to http://mail.projectname.vm:8025
